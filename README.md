# B(l)utter
Flutter Mobile Application Reverse Engineering Tool by Compiling Dart AOT Runtime

Currently the application supports only Android libapp.so (arm64 only).
Also the application is currently work only against recent Dart versions.

For high priority missing features, see [TODO](#todo)


## Environment Setup
origin repo require gcc>=13, because of `std::format`. 
this repo use `fmt::format` instead. so you can use older version of toolchain

my env: ubuntu22.04, gcc 11.4.0, python3.10

### Debian or Ubuntu
- Install build tools and depenencies
```
apt install python3-pyelftools python3-requests git cmake ninja-build \
    build-essential pkg-config libicu-dev libcapstone-dev libfmt-dev
```
### Other system 

Not support. please try origin repo: https://github.com/worawit/blutter

## Usage
Extract "lib" directory from apk file
```
python3 blutter.py path/to/app/lib/arm64-v8a out_dir
```
The blutter.py will automatically detect the Dart version from the flutter engine and call executable of blutter to get the information from libapp.so.

If the blutter executable for required Dart version does not exists, the script will automatically checkout Dart source code and compiling it.

## Update
You can use ```git pull``` to update and run blutter.py with ```--rebuild``` option to force rebuild the executable
```
python3 blutter.py path/to/app/lib/arm64-v8a out_dir --rebuild
```

## Output files
- **asm/\*** libapp assemblies with symbols
- **blutter_frida.js** the frida script template for the target application
- **objs.txt** complete (nested) dump of Object from Object Pool
- **pp.txt** all Dart objects in Object Pool


## Directories
- **bin** contains blutter executables for each Dart version in "blutter_dartvm\<ver\>\_\<os\>\_\<arch\>" format
- **blutter** contains source code. need building against Dart VM library
- **build** contains building projects which can be deleted after finishing the build process
- **dartsdk** contains checkout of Dart Runtime which can be deleted after finishing the build process
- **external** contains 3rd party libraries for Windows only
- **packages** contains the static libraries of Dart Runtime
- **scripts** contains python scripts for getting/building Dart


## Generating Visual Studio Solution for Development
I use Visual Studio to delevlop Blutter on Windows. ```--vs-sln``` options can be used to generate a Visual Studio solution.
```
python blutter.py path\to\lib\arm64-v8a build\vs --vs-sln
```

## TODO
- More code analysis
  - Function arguments and return type
  - Some psuedo code for code pattern
- Generate better Frida script
  - More internal classes
  - Object modification
- Obfuscated app (still missing many functions)
- Reading iOS binary
- Input as apk or ipa
